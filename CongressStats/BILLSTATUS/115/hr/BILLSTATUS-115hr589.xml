and </li> <li>enabling the private sector to partner with the national laboratories to demonstrate novel reactor concepts for the purpose of resolving technical uncertainty. </li> </ul> <p> The title repeals the Nuclear Power 2010 Program, and makes technical corrections removing the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology as the designated entity to conduct the research, development, and demonstration programs on advanced fuel recycling technology and cost-effective technologies for increasing the safety and security of nuclear facilities. (The Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology was replaced in DOE by the Office of Nuclear Energy, the Office of Science, and the Office of Technology Transitions.) </p> <p> The title repeals requirements for development of a comprehensive plan for the operation and maintenance of its facilities at the Idaho National Laboratory to support civilian nuclear energy research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs, including radiological facilities management, isotope production, and facilities management. </p> <p>By December 31, 2017, DOE shall instead determine the mission need for a versatile reactor-based fast neutron source, which shall operate as a national user facility and, if such a need is determined, give Congress a plan to establish the facility. </p> <p>DOE shall ensure that the user facility will provide at a minimum: </p> <ul> <li>fast neutron spectrum irradiation capability, and </li> <li>capacity for upgrades to accommodate new or expanded research needs. </li> </ul> <p>DOE shall, to the maximum extent practicable, complete the construction of, and approve the start of operations for, the user facility by December 31, 2025.</p> <p>DOE shall carry out a program to enhance U.S. capabilities to develop new reactor technologies through high-performance computation modeling and simulation techniques.</p> <p> The title authorizes a program to enable the testing and demonstration of reactor concepts to be proposed and funded by the private sector. DOE shall leverage the technical expertise of relevant federal agencies and the national laboratories to minimize the time required to enable construction and operation of privately funded experimental reactors at national laboratories or other DOE-owned sites. </p> <p>Such reactors shall operate to enable physical validation of novel reactor concepts and general research and development to improve nascent technologies. </p> <p>DOE may enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to share technical expertise and knowledge through:</p> <ul> <li>enabling the testing and demonstration of advanced nuclear reactor concepts to be proposed and funded by the private sector,</li> <li>operating a database to store and share data and knowledge relevant to nuclear science and engineering between federal agencies and the private sector,</li> <li>developing and testing electric and nonelectric integration and energy conversion systems relevant to advanced nuclear reactors,</li> <li>leveraging expertise from the NRC respecting safety analysis, and </li> <li>enabling technical staff of the NRC to observe and learn about technologies developed under the program. </li> </ul> <p>The NRC and DOE shall enter into another memorandum of understanding to ensure that:</p> <ul> <li>DOE has sufficient technical expertise to support the timely research, development, demonstration, and commercial application by the civilian nuclear industry of safe and innovative nuclear reactor technology;</li> <li>the NRC has sufficient technical expertise to support the evaluation of applications for licenses, permits, and design certifications and other requests for regulatory approval for advanced nuclear reactors;</li> <li>the use of computers and software codes to calculate the behavior and performance of such reactors based on mathematical models of their physical behavior;</li> <li>DOE develops and maintains the facilities necessary to enable the timely research, development, demonstration, and commercial application by the civilian nuclear industry of safe and innovative reactor technology; and </li> <li>the NRC has access to those facilities as needed. </li> </ul> <p>DOE shall submit a report to Congress that assesses its capabilities to authorize, host, and oversee privately funded experimental advanced nuclear reactors at the national laboratories or other DOE-owned sites and, once every two years, shall update relevant provisions of such report and submit the updates to Congress. </p> <p> Within 1 year of the bill's enactment, DOE must submit to Congress 2 alternative 10-year budget plans for civilian nuclear energy research and development by DOE, one assuming constant annual funding for 10 years at the appropriated FY2016 level, and the other an unconstrained budget. </p>]]></text>
