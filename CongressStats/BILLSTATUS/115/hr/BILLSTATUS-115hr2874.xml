Properties that have received a claim payment for that period or Increased Cost of Compliance mitigation assistance are not eligible for a refund. </p> <p>(Sec. 206) The GAO must report on the feasibility of reducing flood insurance premiums and eliminating the need for flood insurance coverage by authorizing flood damage savings accounts. </p> <p>(Sec. 207) If determined feasible by the GAO, FEMA must establish a demonstration program for flood damage savings accounts. </p> <p>TITLE III--MAPPING FAIRNESS</p> <p>(Sec. 301) In establishing premium rates, FEMA must use, in part, applicable flood insurance rate maps and other appropriate risk assessment models, data, and tools. </p> <p>(Sec. 302) FEMA denials of requests for updates to flood maps may be appealed. If an appeal is successful, FEMA must refund premiums and the policyholder may be permitted to cancel the policy. </p> <p>(Sec. 303) The bill revises the appeal period for FEMA flood elevation determinations and, if no appeals are filed, makes a determination final. </p> <p>(Sec. 304) This bill amends the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 to revise the time period FEMA provides to communities for consultation regarding mapping changes. </p> <p>(Sec. 305) FEMA must consult with the Department of Defense, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to obtain information relevant to flood insurance mapping. </p> <p>(Sec. 306) The bill revises the duties of the Technical Mapping Advisory Council and FEMA to provide for the development of alternative flood insurance rate maps by states and communities for use in NFIP. </p> <p>TITLE IV--PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND INDIVIDUALS THROUGH IMPROVED MITIGATION</p> <p>(Sec. 401) The bill revises the NFIP community rating program to require (currently, allows) FEMA to provide premium credits in communities that protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions. </p> <p>(Sec. 402) The bill requires a community that participates in NFIP and has been repeatedly flooded to: (1) assess the continuing risks to community areas repeatedly damaged by floods; and (2) develop and implement a publicly available, community-specific plan for mitigating continuing flood risks to such areas.</p> <p>FEMA must, upon request, provide a community with data to assist in preparation of the required plan.</p> <p>In making decisions with respect to awarding mitigation grants under the Act, FEMA may consider the extent to which a community has complied with these requirements and is working to remedy problems with repeatedly flooded areas.</p> <p>A community that does not comply with these requirements shall be subject to sanctions.</p> <p>(Sec. 403) FEMA must make additional coverage available under its Increased Cost of Compliance program. Currently, the program provides coverage to insure the cost of mitigating future flood damage to an NFIP-insured structure that has been substantially or repetitively damaged by floods. </p> <p>TITLE V--PROGRAM INTEGRITY</p> <p>(Sec. 501) The bill makes FEMA responsible for ensuring NFIP is financially sound. FEMA must commission an annual independent actuarial review of the financial status of NFIP. </p> <p>(Sec. 502) The premium surcharge amount on flood insurance is changed to: (1) increase annual surcharges for all primary residences, (2) reduce annual surcharges for certain non-owner occupied residential properties, and (3) increase annual surcharges for all other non-primary residences. </p> <p>(Sec. 503) FEMA must institute a uniform rate of assessment for all policyholders when increasing premiums. </p> <p>During the phase-in period of the required reserve ratio for the NFIP reserve fund, FEMA must increase the annual assessment by at least one percentage point if the required amount was not collected the previous year. </p> <p>(Sec. 504) This bill revises NFIP classifications of properties incurring multiple flood losses and coverage for properties that have incurred multiple flood losses.</p> <p>For properties with two flood insurance claims, FEMA must raise premiums by at least 10% annually if the premiums do not reflect full risk.</p> <p>For properties with three or more claims, FEMA must raise premiums by at least 15% annually if the premiums do not reflect full risk. </p> <p>Certain multiple loss properties are subject to minimum deductibles.</p> <p>FEMA must undertake efforts to validate the accuracy of claim history data.</p> <p>FEMA must deny coverage to a property owner that does not implement flood mitigation measures if the property is an extreme repetitive loss property (a property with cumulative claims that exceed 150% of the maximum coverage amount).</p> <p>Multiple loss properties are not eligible for subsidized premium rates that apply to properties newly mapped into areas with special flood hazards.</p> <p>FEMA must communicate to policyholders the availability of flood mitigation assistance and the effect on premiums of filing further claims for multiple-loss properties. </p> <p>The bill revises the Flood Mitigation Assistance program, including to make assistance available to additional multiple loss properties.</p> <p>(Sec. 505) This bill eliminates NFIP coverage for properties that prospectively exceed specified lifetime levels of claim payments. </p> <p>(Sec. 506) The allowance paid to Write Your Own companies is limited to 27.9% of the premium rate. FEMA must reduce the costs to companies participating in the Write Your Own program. </p> <p>(Sec. 507) This bill amends the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 to increase penalties for violations of the mandatory purchase requirement. </p> <p>(Sec. 508) If a state allows all-perils policies to cover flood damage, property in that state is not subject to NFIP's mandatory purchase requirement. </p> <p>(Sec. 509) The bill raises the maximum loan amount for the small loan exception to NFIP's mandatory purchase requirement from $5,000 to $25,000, adjusted for inflation. </p> <p>A state or local government, or a private lender, may require flood insurance coverage for structures outside a special flood hazard area. </p> <p>(Sec. 510) FEMA must approve claims under NFIP not later than 120 days after a policyholder submits proof of loss. </p> <p>(Sec. 511) FEMA must annually cede a portion of the risk from NFIP to private reinsurance or capital markets. FEMA is also required to establish a probable maximum loss target for the program each fiscal year. </p> <p>(Sec. 512) The GAO must report on options for simplifying NFIP. </p> <p>(Sec. 513) The GAO must report on the mandatory purchase requirement. </p> <p>TITLE VI--ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS</p> <p>(Sec. 601) Fraudulent or false statements in connection with a flood insurance claim under NFIP make a person subject to civil enforcement, penalties, and suspension from the program. The bill directs FEMA to refer evidence of this activity to the Department of Justice.</p> <p>(Sec. 602) FEMA is directed to revise the appeals process for policyholders seeking review of a flood insurance claim denial by their insurer.
