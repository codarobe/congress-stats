Requires the President to provide an opportunity for public comment on the strategy.</p> <p>Requires such strategy to seek to: (1) prioritize assistance to U.S. partner countries whose populations are most in need of improved basic education; (2) build the capacity of relevant actors in partner countries to develop national education plans that improve basic education; (3) identify and replicate successful interventions that improve access to and quality of basic education in conflict settings and in partner countries; (4) develop means to track implementation in partner countries and ensure that such countries are expending appropriate domestic resources and instituting relevant legal, regulatory, or institutional reforms; (5) leverage U.S. capabilities, including through technical assistance, training, and research; and (6) improve coordination and reduce duplication among relevant agencies, donors, multilateral and nongovernmental organizations, and partner country governments. </p> <p>(Sec. 5) Establishes within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) the position of Senior Coordinator of United States International Basic Education Assistance, who shall have primary responsibility for the oversight and coordination of U.S. government resources and activities relating to the promotion of international basic education. Requires the President to eliminate a USAID position in order to offset costs and eliminate duplication of activities involved in appointing such senior coordinator. </p> <p>(Sec. 6) Requires the President to ensure that programs carried out under the comprehensive strategy: (1) apply monitoring and evaluation methodologies to determine if programs and activities accomplish measurable improvements in literacy or other basic skills development; (2) include funding for both short- and long-term monitoring and evaluation; and (3) disaggregate as appropriate all data collected by age, gender, marital status, disability, and location. </p> <p>(Sec. 7) Requires the President to submit to Congress an annual implementation report. </p> <p>DIVISION B--SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR DISASTER RELIEF REQUIREMENTS ACT, 2017 </p> <p><em>Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements, 2017 </em></p> <p>Provides $15.25 billion in FY2017 supplemental appropriations to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for disaster relief requirements, such as response and recovery efforts from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. </p> <p>Specifies that the $15.25 billion includes: </p> <ul> <li> $7.4 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, </li> <li> $450 million for the SBA's Disaster Loans Program Account, and </li> <li> $7.4 billion for HUD's Community Development Block Grant program. </li> </ul> <p>Designates the funds as an emergency requirement and provides that the funds are only available if the President subsequently designates the funds and transmits the designation to Congress. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.) </p> <p>DIVISION C--TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF PUBLIC DEBT RELIEF </p> <p>(Sec. 101) Suspends the public debt limit through December 8, 2017. Increases the limit on December 9, 2017, to accommodate obligations issued during the suspension period. </p> <p>Specifies that adjustments to the debt limit for obligations during the suspension period are limited to obligations necessary to fund a commitment incurred by the federal government that required payment before December 9, 2017. </p> <p>Prohibits the Department of the Treasury from issuing obligations during the suspension period to increase cash balances above normal operating balances. </p> <p>DIVISION D--CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 </p> <p><em>Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 </em></p> <p>(This division provides continuing appropriations to federal agencies through December 8, 2017, or the enactment of specified appropriations legislation. </p> <p>It is known as a continuing resolution [CR] and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when FY2018 begins on October 1, 2017, if the twelve FY2017 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have not been enacted. </p> <p>Unless otherwise indicated, all extensions and provisions referenced in the summary of this division are for the duration of the CR.) </p> <p>(Sec. 101) Provides FY2018 appropriations to federal agencies for continuing projects or activities at the levels of, and under the terms and conditions of specified FY2017 appropriations Acts, reduced by 0.6791%. </p> <p>Permits the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of the Interior to use emergency funding provided for wildfire suppression to fully repay amounts previously transferred from other accounts for wildfire suppression. </p> <p>(Sec. 102) Prohibits the Department of Defense (DOD) from using funds provided by section 101 for starting new programs, entering into multi-year contracts, or increasing production rates. </p> <p>(Sec. 103) Specifies that funds provided by section 101 shall be available to the extent and in the manner that would be provided in the pertinent appropriations Act. </p> <p>(Sec. 104) Prohibits any appropriations or funds made available by section 101 from being used to initiate or resume any project or activity which was not funded in FY2017. </p> <p>(Sec. 105) Continues all authorities, requirements, and limitations from FY2017 appropriations Acts through the date in section 106 and permits valid obligations and expenditures during the period of this CR. </p> <p>(Sec. 106) Continues the appropriations provided by this division through the earlier of December 8, 2017, or the enactment of the pertinent appropriations bill. </p> <p>(Sec. 107) Requires expenditures for activities funded in this division to be charged to the relevant account when the applicable appropriations bill becomes law. </p> <p>(Sec. 108) Waives the normal time limitations for submission and approval of apportionments of accounts funded in annual appropriations Acts. </p> <p>(Sec. 109) Limits disbursements for programs that otherwise would have high initial rates of operation or would complete distribution of funding at the beginning of the fiscal year if those actions would impinge on final congressional funding prerogatives. </p> <p>(Sec. 110) Requires this division be implemented so that only the most limited funding action permitted by this division is taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities. </p> <p>(Sec. 111) Provides that entitlements and other mandatory payments with budget authority provided in FY2017 appropriations bills and for activities under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 shall continue at the rate to maintain program levels under current law and under the authority and conditions provided in the applicable FY2017 appropriations Act for up to 30 days after the expiration of the CR. </p> <p>(Sec. 112) Permits funding made available by this division for civilian personnel compensation and benefits in each department and agency to be apportioned up to the rate of operations necessary to avoid furloughs.
