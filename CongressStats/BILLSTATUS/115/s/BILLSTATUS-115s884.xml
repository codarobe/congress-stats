          <text><![CDATA[<p>This bill amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 to specify that a reason that a small miner's application for a claim maintenance fee waiver may be determined to be defective, in order for such clamant to qualify for 60 days to cure the defects or pay the maintenance fee due, shall include the failure to timely file either such application or an affidavit of annual labor associated with the application and required application fees.</p> <p>The holders of specified claims in Alaska are considered to qualify for such relief and opportunity to cure such defect(s) for any prior period during which: (1) one or more defects existed in their waiver application, (2) an affidavit of annual labor associated with such application was not properly filed, or (3) there existed a failure to pay claim maintenance fees.</p> <p>The bill amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to require the Department of the Interior to notify by registered mail an owner of a mining claim or mill or tunnel site of such owner's failure to timely file an instrument required by such Act for recording such owner's mining claim. Such owner shall have 60 days after receiving such notification to file that instrument. </p>]]></text>
